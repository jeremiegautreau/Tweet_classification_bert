# Tweet_classification_bert
This project aims to test the fine-tuning of a large language model (LLM) for text classification.<br>
The dataset consists of tweets from four French presidential candidates.<br>
The task is to identify the candidate based on their tweet.<br>
The LLM used is CamemBERT, a pretrained BERT model on a French corpus.<br>
<br>
The performance after fine-tuning is quite good, with an F1 score of 0.87.
