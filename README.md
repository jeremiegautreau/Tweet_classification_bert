# Tweet_classification_bert
This project aims to test the fine-tuning of a large language model (LLM) for text classification.
The dataset consists of tweets from four French presidential candidates.
The task is to identify the candidate based on their tweet.
The LLM used is CamemBERT, a pretrained BERT model on a French corpus.

The performance after fine-tuning is quite good, with an F1 score of 0.87.
